**MINIKUBE**:

Minikube is a tool that allows you to run Kubernetes clusters locally. It’s particularly useful for developers who want to test and develop applications in a Kubernetes environment without needing to set up a 
full cluster on remote servers.Minikube creates a single-node Kubernetes cluster in a virtual machine or on your local machine, enabling you to experiment with Kubernetes features and deploy applications easily. 
It supports various virtualization drivers, including VirtualBox, VMware, and Docker, making it flexible for different development setups.

**kubernetes(k8s)**:

Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform designed to automate the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. Originally developed by Google, it helps you manage applications running in containers (like Docker) across a cluster of machines, providing features like:

1. **Automatic Scaling**: Adjusts the number of container replicas based on load.
2. **Load Balancing**: Distributes traffic to ensure no single container is overwhelmed.
3. **Self-Healing**: Automatically restarts or replaces containers that fail.
4. **Service Discovery**: Allows containers to communicate with each other and find services dynamically.
5. **Rolling Updates**: Facilitates seamless updates to applications without downtime.

Kubernetes is widely used in modern cloud-native development, making it easier to manage complex applications and microservices architectures.

**ORCHESTRATION**:

Orchestration in the context of computing refers to the automated arrangement, coordination, and management of complex software systems and services. It involves using tools and processes to manage the deployment, scaling, and operations of applications, especially those composed of multiple services or components.

In cloud computing and container management, orchestration helps to:

1. **Automate Deployment**: Simplifies the process of deploying applications across multiple environments.
2. **Manage Resources**: Optimizes resource allocation, ensuring efficient use of compute, memory, and storage.
3. **Scale Applications**: Automatically adjusts the number of running instances based on demand.
4. **Ensure Reliability**: Monitors systems and automatically handles failures, like restarting crashed services or distributing load.
5. **Manage Dependencies**: Coordinates interactions between different services and components to ensure they work together smoothly.

Overall, orchestration makes it easier to manage complex, distributed systems, improving efficiency and reliability.

**Deploy the cloud**

1. Instal the openstack snap

Begin by installing the openstack snap:

    sudo snap install openstack --channel 2024.1/beta

2.Prepare the machine

Sunbeam can generate a script to ensure that the machine has all of the required dependencies installed and is configured correctly
for use in OpenStack - you can review this script using:

    sunbeam prepare-node-script

or the script can be directly executed in this way:

    sunbeam prepare-node-script | bash -x && newgrp snap_daemon

The script will ensure some software requirements are satisfied on the host. In particular, it will:

⏺️install openssh-server if it is not found

⏺️configure passwordless sudo for all commands for the current user (NOPASSWD:ALL)

3.Bootstrap the cloud

Deploy the OpenStack cloud using the cluster bootstrap command and accept software defaults:

    sunbeam cluster bootstrap --accept-defaults

4.Configure the cloud and obtain credentials

Now configure the deployed cloud using the configure command:

    sunbeam configure --accept-defaults --openrc demo-openrc

The --openrc option specifies a regular user (non-admin) cloud init file (demo-openrc here).

# LAUNCH a VM

Verify the cloud by launching a VM called ‘test’ based on the ‘ubuntu’ image (Ubuntu 22.04 LTS). The launch command is used:

    sunbeam launch ubuntu --name test

Sample output:

Launching an OpenStack instance ...
Access instance with 

`ssh -i /home/ubuntu/.config/openstack/sunbeam ubuntu@10.20.20.200`

Connect to the VM over SSH using the provided command.
